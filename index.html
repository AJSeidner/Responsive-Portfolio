			<p>Hello there, I'm A.J Seidner.  I'm new to the world of coding, but eager to learn as much as I can.  Looking at my photo, you may be inclined to ask if I can turn left.  I can tell you that I certainly can.  I've been playing music in Austin Texas for some time, most notably Dead Tree Duo.  I enjoy many things, and right now I'm really enjoying filling this text area with words as to do a proper mock up of the page.  I first just typed in gibberish, but the long one word made the layout strange, so I figured it would be better to fill in the space with individual words...like, real words.  Speaking of, I'd imagine it's important to spell check these things before uploading it.  Sometimes my brand new computer does stupid things and it's really frustrating. </p>
